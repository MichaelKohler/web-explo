# Web Explo

Random explorations for Web APIs and concepts. This can be just running an "starter template" or going further and adjusting it. Or just a simple HTML document. Whatever fits the need. There most likely is nothing to see here though.

## Explorations

* `lit`: general explorations of some of `lit`'s concepts. Using `vite`.
* `lit-js-only`: wondered how it would look like to boostrap `lit` with JS only. Also using `vite`. No custom changes here.
* `node-timers`: quick exploration on promise based setInterval using for await
* `remix-vite`: simple test of the vite integration of remix. No custom changes here.`
* `web-worker-origin-private-file-system`: example using the Origin Private File System through Web Workers
