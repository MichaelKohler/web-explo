# Web Explo

Random explorations for Web APIs and concepts. This can be just running an "starter template" or going further and adjusting it. Or just a simple HTML document. Whatever fits the need. There most likely is nothing to see here though.

## Explorations

* `lit`: general explorations of some of `lit`'s concepts. Using `vite`.
* `lit-js-only`: wondered how it would look like to boostrap `lit` with JS only. Also using `vite`. No custom changes here.
